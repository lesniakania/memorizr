= vidibus-routing_error

This gem is part of the open source SOA framework Vidibus: http://www.vidibus.org

Catches ActionController::RoutingError which does not work with Rails 3 out of the box. It basically catches the exception on Rack-level and re-raises it on application-level.


== Installation

Add the dependency to the Gemfile of your application:

  gem "vidibus-routing_error"

Then call bundle install on your console.


== Usage

With this gem installed, you are able to handle errors like in past versions of Rails:

  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    rescue_from ActionController::RoutingError, :with => :rescue_404

    def rescue_404
      # do something
      # IMPORTANT: If you modify this method, you have to restart the server.
    end
  end

Keep in mind that you have to restart your server when changing the rescue-method!
