 * Thx to jeweler this is now a gem

 * All lint and rails_compliance specs pass.

 * Simplified #errors default implementation

 * Only rely on active_model/lint for amo compliance specs

 * Refactored rails_compliance_spec a bit

 * Make it easy to move rails compliance specs to rails_datamapper

    active_model/lint itself isn't really strict about what exact
    String it gets back from either of the following methods that
    are supported by the object returned from #class.model_name

      #singular
      #plural
      #element
      #human
      #collection
      #partial_path

    All lint cares about, is that these methods return Strings

    Therefore it's probably best to push specs that test for
    rails's own implementation of those active_model strings
    down to something like rails_datamapper.

    Currently the rails compliance specs for #collection and
    #partial_path fail. Need to investigate this.

 * All specs pass, changed dm-core dependency to '~>0.10'

[5cb1320 | Wed Sep 23 23:27:42 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * Also run active_model/lint when running the specsuite

    Currently, if dm-validations are not required, all specs
    pass. If dm-validations are required, 1 spec fails because
    DataMapper::Validate::ValidationErrors seems to implement
    #[](field) in an incompatible way. This will need more
    investigation.

    If this can be fixed upstream, all specs should pass

 * Added implementation and initial specs

    The final goal is to rely solely on active_model/lint.rb
    to perform the compliance tests. However, lint.rb still
    needs to be updated to cover the intended behavior more
    precisely.

    Nevertheless, next step is to include active_model as a
    development dependency and run both lint.rb and our own
    specs for the time being.
